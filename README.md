# WheelOfFortune

Hello, and welcome to my Wheel of Fortune project!

For my assessment, I was asked to use python to create a Wheel of Fortune - like computer game.

First, I drafted out my plan with pseudocode, which can be seen in the plans file for this project.

Then, I used the pseudocode outline to create a game. I hope you like it!
