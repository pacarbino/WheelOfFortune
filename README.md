# WheelOfFortune

Hello, and welcome to my Wheel of Fortune project!

For my assessment, I was asked to use python to create a Wheel of Fortune - like computer game.

First, I drafted out my plan with pseudocode, which can be seen in the plans file for this project.

I then used the pseudocode as a blueprint and began coding between the lines of a copied file.

"test test" is the most up to date file where I'm testing out and debugging new code.

Once working, I then copied the working code into "WheelOfFortuneFinalFile", which is intended to be the file for public use and grading.

I hope you like it!
