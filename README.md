# WheelOfFortune

Hello, and welcome to my Wheel of Fortune project!

For my assessment, I was asked to use python to create a Wheel of Fortune - like computer game.

First, I drafted out my plan with pseudocode, which can be seen in the plans file for this project.

I then used the pseudocode as a blueprint and began coding between the lines of a copied file.

"EnglishWords.txt" is the file used to import a random word for the puzzles.

"WheelOfFortuneRules", both text and python files, are the rules I outlined for the game, just in different file formats.

"WheelOfFortuneDraft" is the file where I began the rougher outline of what I was going to be doing. It is not very current at this point.

"test test" is the most up to date file where I'm testing out and debugging new code.

Once working, I then copied the working code into "WheelOfFortuneFinalFile", which is intended to be the file for public use and grading.

I hope you like it!
