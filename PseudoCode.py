## create list of words to choose from (CSV file not necessary. text file accepltable)
## create list of wheel spaces to choose from (19 spots, not 24. 100-900 in $50 increments, plus lose a turn, plus bankrupt)
## create blanks (gameboard) list
## create letters guessed list
## create random mystery prize list (or, you can just do a flat ammount)

## create perm bank for player 1
## create perm bank for player 2
## create perm bank for player 3

## create random word generator using word list
    ## creates word to be guessed
    ## appends blanks (gameboard) list
## create random wheel space generator from list
## create random mystery prize generator from list

    ## call random word generator
