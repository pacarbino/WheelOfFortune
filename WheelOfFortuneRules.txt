    Welcome to Wheel of Fortune! 
    For those of you who have never played, 
    we're going to go over the rules of the game!
    
    A puzzle will be presented to you as a series of blanks an a gameboard.
    These blanks represent letters in a word that you have to guess.

    You have three choices of moves to make at the start of your turn:
        
        1) Spin the wheel! 
        
        If the wheel lands on a dollar amount,
        you can then try to guess one of the consonants in the word.

        If the letter you guess is in the word, the blanks on the gameboard
        will be replaced by the letter, and you will recieve the dollar amount 
        which your spin landed on multiplied times the number of times the 
        letter appears in the word. Your turn continues, and you are once again
        able to choose what you'd like to do next.
        
        If the letter is NOT in the word, you recieve no money for that spin. 
        Your turn is over, and the next player's turn begins.
        
        If the wheel lands on 'Lose A Turn', your turn immediately ends,
        and the next player's turn begins..
        
        If the wheel lands on 'Bankruptcy', you lose all the money in 
        your bank for that round, your turn ends, and the next player's turn begins..
        
        2) Buy a vowel! 
        
        If you have at least $250 in your current bank, you may choose
        to buy a vowel that you think might be in the puzzle.

        If you are right, the blanks in the gameboard are replaced by
        the vowel you've chosen, your turn continues, and you may once again
        choose which move you'd like to make next. 
        
        If you are wrong, your turn ends. 

        Either way, $250 is deducted from your bank for that round.
        
        3) Solve the puzzle!
        
        If you think you know what the word is, you may choose to 
        solve the puzzle. You guess a word, and if you are right, the
        puzzle is solved and all the money you've won from that round
        is transfered to your permanent bank.
        
        If you guess incorrectly, your turn ends, and the next player's turn begins.
        
    This cycle continues moving from player 1 to 2 to 3 and then back to plyer 1 until
    the puzzle is solved. After 2 rounds, the player with the most money in their
    permanent bank goes on to the bonus round 3.

    In round 3, the player is once again presented with a puzzle on gameboard.
    however, in this round, there is no spinning the wheel. Instead, 
    the default letters 'R, S, T, L, N, E' will be checked against the 
    puzzle and the gameboard will change to show where any of those letters
    are if they are in the puzzle.

    Next the player will select 3 more consonants and 1 more vowel.
    These letters will then be checked against the puzzle and revealed
    in the same manner as the letters above. 

    Player will then have 1 guess to try and solve the puzzle.

    If they guess correctly, they win the bonus prize of $25,000
    on top of all the money they won from the previous rounds.

    If they guess incorrectly, they still get to keep the money from the previous rounds,
    however they will not get the additional $25,000 prize.

    So, who's ready to play...

    Wheel!  Of!  Fortune!!!!!
